## 📌 Project Overview
This project detects and recognizes handwritten alphabet characters using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). It processes image inputs and maps them to corresponding characters.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Install dependencies:  
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`

2. Run the training script or load the saved model.

3. Use the interface (if any) or run prediction code to classify new handwritten input images.
